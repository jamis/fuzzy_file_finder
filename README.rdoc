= FuzzyFileFinder

FuzzyFileFinder is a (somewhat improved) implementation of TextMate's "cmd-T" functionality. It allows you to search for a file by specifying a pattern of characters that appear in that file's name. Unlike TextMate, FuzzyFileFinder also lets you match against the file's directory, so you can more easily scope your search.

== FEATURES:

* Quickly search directory trees for files
* Avoids accidentally scanning huge directories by implementing a ceiling (default 10,000 entries)
* Simple highlighting of matches to discover how a pattern matched

== SYNOPSIS:

In a nutshell:

  require 'fuzzy_file_finder'

  finder = FuzzyFileFinder.new

  finder.search "app/blogcon" do |match|
    puts "[%5d] %s" % [match[:score] * 10000, match[:highlighted_path]]
  end

  matches = finder.find("app/blogcon").sort_by { |m| [-m[:score], m[:path] }
  matches.each do |match|
    puts "[%5d] %s" % [match[:score] * 10000, match[:highlighted_path]]
  end
